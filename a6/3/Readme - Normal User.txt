1. For running the program use command ./binary where "binary" is the name of the binary.
2. Enter the 2 operands upon which you wish to perform the operation(choosen in next step) one by one.
3. Choose the operation (Sum/Hidden Function) by entering the corresponding number (1 for Sum and 2 for Hidden Function)
4. The program wil ask for a PassKey regardless of operation to verify whether you are a SuperUser/Normal User. Even if Passkey for SuperUser is not correct you can still execute Sum operation using 1 and get Sum result but for you to execute Hidden Function you need to enter correct Passkey for SuperUser(assuming you are SuperUser or found a way to become SuperUser/execute the Hidden Function)
5. Accordingly the program will display the result.
